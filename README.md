# ATNet Dataset Evaluation

This repository provides an evaluation of the performance and generalization capability of [AT-Net](https://github.com/rajeevyasarla/AT-Net) across several turbulence mitigation datasets. The repository includes scripts and tools for both the training and deployment pipelines, focusing on adaptability and reproducibility of results.

# TurbNet Deployment on Qualcomm AI Hub

This repository also investigates the impact of deploying a pre-trained [TurbNet](https://github.com/VITA-Group/TurbNet/blob/main/main.py) model on the Qualcomm AI Hub, specifically targeting chips equipped with NPUs (Neural Processing Units) optimized for INT8 quantized weights and activations. We analyze the performance degradation that occurs during deployment and explore strategies to mitigate this degradation, including both post-training quantization and quantization-aware training.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains only the Python files that were modified from the original upstream repositories, organized into appropriately named folders to reflect their usage and purpose.
